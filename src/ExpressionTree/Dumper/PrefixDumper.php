/**
 * Dumps a tree into a prefix expression representation.
 *
 * A tree node will be treated as an "operator", and it will be dumped
 * as the list of the children dumps separated by the node value.
 * If a child is a tree it will be enclosed by brackets
 *
 * A leaf node will be dumped as its value.
 *
 * Nodes values must be string-castable.
 *
 * Example: the tree
 *
 *              *
 *             / \
 *            +   10
 *           / \
 *          1   3
 *
 * Will be dumped as
 *
 *   *(+(1 3) 10)
